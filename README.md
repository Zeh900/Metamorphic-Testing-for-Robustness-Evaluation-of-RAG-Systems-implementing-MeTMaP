# Metamorphic-Testing-for-Robustness-Evaluation-of-RAG-Systems-implementing-MeTMaP









This repository was created as part of my thesis project in computer engineering at the University of Naples Federico II and it contains the scripts used to implement the process described in the paper "MeTMaP: Metamorphic Testing for Detecting False Vector Matching Problems in LLM Augmented Generation".
